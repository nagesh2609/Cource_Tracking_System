# Cource_Tracking_System
The Course Monitoring System is an automated system that can be used to monitor the progress of students in a particular course. The system can be used to track the progress of students from the beginning to the end of the course. It can also be used to monitor the performance of students in each assignment and exam, as well as track the attendance and overall grade of the student. The system can also be used to generate reports for the instructor, which can be used to evaluate the performance of the students in a particular course. This system can also be used to generate alerts for the instructor when a student is having difficulty with a particular assignment or exam.
